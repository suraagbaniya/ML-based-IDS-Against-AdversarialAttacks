# 🛡️ ML-based IDS Against Adversarial Attacks

A Machine Learning–based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) focused on identifying malicious network activities while maintaining robustness against adversarial evasion and manipulation techniques.

---

## 📖 Introduction
Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems often fail when attackers deliberately craft network traffic to evade detection. This project addresses this challenge by integrating **machine learning–driven intrusion detection** with **adversarial attack evaluation**, aiming to improve the resilience and reliability of IDS models in real-world attack scenarios.

The system evaluates how adversarially modified inputs affect detection accuracy and explores defensive strategies to mitigate such threats.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Design and implement an ML-based IDS for network intrusion detection  
- Analyze the impact of adversarial attacks on IDS performance  
- Improve detection robustness against evasion and poisoning techniques  
- Provide real-time visibility of alerts through a web-based dashboard  

---

## 🚀 Key Features
- Machine learning–based detection of malicious network traffic  
- Simulation of adversarial attacks (evasion and data poisoning)  
- Comparative evaluation of IDS performance under normal and adversarial conditions  
- Web-based dashboard for monitoring alerts, predictions, and logs
